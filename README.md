 Breast Cancer Classification using SVM

 ðŸ“Œ Task :
 
This project is part of the AI & ML Internship Task 7 by Elevate Labs. The goal is to perform binary classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with both linear and non-linear (RBF) kernels.

 ðŸ“‚ Dataset :
 
We used the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset]

- Rows: ~570
- Target Variable: diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign)
- Features: 30 numeric input features (mean, standard error, worst of various cancer cell attributes)

 ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries :
 
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

 ðŸ“ˆ Key Features :
 
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- SVM with linear and RBF kernel
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Performance metrics using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Cross-validation
